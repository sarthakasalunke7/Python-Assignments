# Design a Python application that creates two threads named Thread1 and Thread2.
# • Thread1 should display numbers from 1 to 50.
# • Thread2 should display numbers from 50 to 1 in reverse order.
# • Ensure that:
#   ◦ Thread2 starts execution only after Thread1 has completed.
# • Use appropriate thread synchronizatio
