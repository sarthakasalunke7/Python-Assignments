# Design a Python application that creates two threads named EvenFactor and OddFactor.
# • Both threads should accept one integer number as a parameter.
# • The EvenFactor thread should:
#   ◦ Identify all even factors of the given number.
#   ◦ Calculate and display the sum of even factors.
# • The OddFactor thread should:
#   ◦ Identify all odd factors of the given number.
#   ◦ Calculate and display the sum of odd factors.
# • After both threads complete execution, the main thread should display the message: “Exit from main”
