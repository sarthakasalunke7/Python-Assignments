# Design a Python application that creates two separate threads named Even and Odd.
# • The Even thread should display the first 10 even numbers.
# • The Odd thread should display the first 10 odd numbers.
# • Both threads should execute independently using the threading module.
# • Ensure proper thread creation and execution.
