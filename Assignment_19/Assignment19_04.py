# Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which
# contains one list of numbers. List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter
# should filter out all such numbers which are even. Map function will calculate its square.
# Reduce will return addition of all that numbers.
# Input List = [5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 8, 10]
# List after filter = [2, 4, 4, 2, 8, 10]
# List after map = [4, 16, 16, 4, 64, 100]
# Output of reduce = 204
